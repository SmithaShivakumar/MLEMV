Description: Given a sequence of observed underlying and corresponding near expiry, constant maturity, ATM options
    An unknown parameter vector model is initialized. For each new parameter set p generated by the numerical optimization routine, 
    the value of Yt which satisfies the option price is computed. This requires solving a nested one dimensional convex optimization,
    with linear bound constraints of Ct -> Yt
    With Yt and p, Volatility of the option is computed.
    Finally the log likelihood is minimized over the parameters of the vector model subject to the Feller condition.
